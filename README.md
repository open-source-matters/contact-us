# Reach out to the Board of Open Source Matters, Inc.

This repository has been created as a public discussion &amp; proposal place.
Share your ideas, proposals, comments and suggestions, we are open to hear you!
We want to simplify the ways to get in touch with the Board of OSM, allowing everyone to contribute to discussions with ideas, suggestions and feedback.

This place is public, you don't need to be a member of OSM, or Glip or whatever. 
Anyone can post a discussion and we encourage you to do so.
Your feedback is precious.

Let's improve, together!
